# Preface

This publication is intended for learners of perfect clearing, aspiring perfect clear theorists, as well as Tetris players with a mind for exploring theoretical perfect clear concepts. Emphasis is not placed on practical techniques such as setups but on the tools we have developed to analyze the field and the piece queue in conjunction with modern Tetris mechanics such as holding.

The writer hopes this will help publicise perfect clear theory and establish a standard for the nomenclature and jargon that is used within the lively community JimothyJimothy founded that is PC Gang to which I was invited by Windcatcher.
