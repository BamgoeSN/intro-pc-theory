Serious PC practitioners should invest their time in studying setups for each PC as well as in solving them. Various resources exist:

- knewjade, one of the all-time greats, has penned a couple of [articles](https://gist.github.com/knewjade/2b8620cf81b7dd9ecc0e75a6084b536d) regarding PC theory and devised a [system](https://knewjade.github.io/tetris-knowledge/2pcsystem/index.html) for the first two PCs, among other influential achievements, most if not all of which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/knewjade). These are, however, in Japanese.

- Eminent PC player Nilgiri maintains a list of 1st PC setups available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sSrG3BpEr1UjtJ_c-W8XfPJDs41RLPUR/view?usp=sharing).

- [FOUR](https://four.lol/) by davdav1233 and cosin307, [Tetris Wiki](https://harddrop.com/wiki/Tetris_Wiki) by Hard Drop community, [テトリス開幕テンプレ Wiki](https://tetrisopener.wicurio.com/) (Japanese) by yuu, [テトリス堂](https://shiwehi.com/tetris/) (Japanese) by shiwehi, and [テトリステンプレ集](https://w.atwiki.jp/tetrismaps/) (Japanese) by biseki, seirei, and mipi, all provide a set of common openers and PC setups and should suffice for players of all skill levels.

- Your humble writer himself actively maintains a list of setups with graphics, statistics, and Jstris practice modes available at [tinyurl.com/perfectclearsetups](https://tinyurl.com/perfectclearsetups).

More casual players and budding PC enthusiasts may find themselves training the common opener PCO, for which [this tool](https://davdav1233.github.io/ttpc/) (Japanese) by sakuramochi84 and davdav1233 may be useful.

If you are not interested in the actual action, PC research may be for you. We use PC finding software to investigate potential setups that can then be used in consecutive PC runs and multiplayer matches alike.

Finally, reap the rewards of your labour and challenge yourself to consecutive PCs at [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/play/PC) or [KoS](https://kingofstackers.com/new_pcb.php). The editorial wishes the readers the best of luck in their future PC endeavours.
